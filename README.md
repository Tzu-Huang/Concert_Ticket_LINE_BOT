# Concert_Ticket_LINE_Bot 
This project is a Python-based system that automatically searches for upcoming concerts in Taiwan for specific artists. 
It uses web scraping (e.g., KKTIX) and Google Custom Search to retrieve event details and promotional images. 
The bot checks for updates and notifies users‚Äîsuch as through a LINE Bot‚Äîwhen new concert information becomes available. 
It supports artist tracking, data filtering, and media integration to deliver timely, accurate concert updates.

## How to Run
```
python app.py
```

## LOG
### 5/20/2025
- Implemented fallback image handling using Cloudinary
    1. Use Cloudinary for more control and reliability
    2. Added a upload_to_cloudinary(image_url) function that validates content type is image/* before uploading
- Update get_best_concert_info_line() to:
    1. Automatically upload fetched images to Cloudinary
    2. Integrate fallback logic and prevent invalid or broken image URLs from being used
