# Concert_Ticket_LINE_Bot 
This project is a Python-based system that automatically searches for upcoming concerts in Taiwan for specific artists. 
It uses web scraping (e.g., KKTIX) and Google Custom Search to retrieve event details and promotional images. 
The bot checks for updates and notifies users—such as through a LINE Bot—when new concert information becomes available. 
It supports artist tracking, data filtering, and media integration to deliver timely, accurate concert updates.

## How to Run
```
python get_concert_from_google.py
```
